1095	@PROTEIN$ promoter hypermethylation correlates with a survival benefit from @COMPOUND$ in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma but not glioblastoma.	1
1096	Inhibition of P-@PROTEIN$-mediated @COMPOUND$ resistance by reversibly linked quinine homodimers.	1
1097	The data provide the first demonstration for the presence of @PROTEIN$ in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells, and a functional @COMPOUND$-signaling pathway, which targets ciliary channel function and may help control the sensory function of the primary cilium.	0
1098	The endothelial (Ca(2+))(@COMPOUND$) response to @PROTEIN$ (100 nM) was significantly attenuated.	1
